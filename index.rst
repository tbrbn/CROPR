CROPR
========

Welcome! If you're reading this it means you purchased or are considering purchasing CROPR.
This documentation will guide you on how to handle the application.

CROPR is a small stand-alone application that speeds up the necessary yet annoying
cropping and scaling of blueprints view before starting to actually model.

Features
--------

By drawing large bounding boxes around each view, CROPR automatically generate a smaller bounding box
that contains the desired portion of the blueprint. The generated bounding boxes
are exactly on the correct pixel.
Once all the views are ready, CROPR scales them accordingly so each view are aligned and matching each other.

The next step is simply to import the generated views into the 3D software of your choice.


Installation
------------

Simply run the executable file you downloaded
